# ClassicCraft
ClassicCraft is a modified version of the original code used to launch classic versions of Minecraft on Mojang's website, which has been sadly removed in 2014 to create a new Classic Minecraft client. Unlike other clients, ClassicCraft is being developed with no new features added in, which other classic clients fail to achieve, in an attempt to make it as authentic as possible.

# How To Play
The ClassicCraft launcher isn't quite ready to play yet. However, it is under extremely active development and has an estimated completion date of Summer 2017; stay tuned for more info.
