# ClassicCraft
ClassicCraft is a modified version of the original code used to launch classic versions of Minecraft on Mojang's website, which has been sadly removed in 2014 to create a new Classic Minecraft client. Unlike other clients, ClassicCraft is being developed with no new features added in, which other classic clients fail to achieve.

# How To Play
The ClassicCraft launcher isn't quite ready to play yet. However, it is under extremely active development and has an estimated completion date of June 2017; stay tuned for more info.
