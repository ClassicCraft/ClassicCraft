# ClassicCraft
ClassicCraft is a modified version of the original code used to launch classic versions of Minecraft on Mojang's website, which has been sadly removed in 2015. Unlike other fan-made classic clients, ClassicCraft is being developed with no new features added in, which other classic clients fail to achieve, in an attempt to make it as authentic as possible.

# How To Play
ClassicCraft isn't quite ready to play yet. However, it is under extremely active development. Launcher mode has an estimated release date of Summer 2017, while Online mode is coming in Fall 2017. Stay tuned for more info.
